Easily contribute to latest Pharo

- just clone the project

```
git clone https://github.com/astares/pharo-contributor.git
```


- use "download.sh" to download latest P7 automatically and started, it will also load a contribution 
  help book I did where all is explained

- For a quick start usually you just have to go to the very last help page of the appearing help tool and click 
  on 

```Smalltalk
CPTCloneTool run
```

  to automagically download and update you fork (after giving your Github username)

Then you can contribute as usual by having a branch for a bug number in Iceberg and so on.
